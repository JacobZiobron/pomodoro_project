# What is a pomodoro timer?

A Pomodoro timer is a time management technique that helps individuals enhance their productivity and focus. It follows a simple concept of breaking work or study sessions into intervals called "Pomodoros." Each Pomodoro typically lasts for 25 minutes, followed by a short break of around 5 minutes. After completing a set of four Pomodoros, a more extended break of 15-30 minutes is taken.

The technique is named after a tomato-shaped kitchen timer called a "Pomodoro" in Italian. The main idea behind the Pomodoro timer is to work in short bursts of focused effort, allowing for regular breaks to prevent burnout and maintain concentration. By dividing work into manageable intervals, it promotes better time management, reduces distractions, and improves overall productivity.

Pomodoro timers can be physical devices or digital tools, such as smartphone apps or web-based timers. These timers help individuals track their work intervals and breaks, providing visual or auditory cues to indicate when to start and stop each Pomodoro session.
